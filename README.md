# Self Experiment @ UnivTerbuka

A repository for all materials, practices, and experiments during my studies at Universitas Terbuka.

## Background

As a student at Universitas Terbuka, my learning journey primarily takes place online. This mode of learning often involves assignments, projects, and self-practice that generate various digital files. Over time, these files accumulate, forming a valuable record of my academic progress.

## Purpose

This repository was initially intended solely to store all files used during my studies, including projects. However, it seemed a waste to discard these files after use. Therefore, this repository serves as an archive of all files used during my academic journey.

> [!NOTE]
> _All files in this repository are free to use by anyone. If you intend to use them for assignments at Universitas Terbuka, please use these files as references or examples only._

> [!WARNING]
> _Use these files wisely. The owner of this repository is not responsible for any risks arising from the use of these files._
